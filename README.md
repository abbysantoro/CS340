How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

Maintaining a program would entail adding functionality and keeping it up to date, which just requires that you make everything modular and reusable. This makes it possible to expand on a program without constantly needing to rebuild it. To make your code readable, follow a logical flow, and include detailed comments that explain what the reader is looking at. Maintainability and adaptability go hand in hand. If your code is modular and each function only does one primary task, then you may modify that function to almost any other incoming or exiting data type to meet your current needs.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

As a computer scientist, I would approach an issue by first identifying the tools I would require to get the desired result. Then, I would construct the most fundamental tools first, followed by the code that executes those lower-level operations. I tried my best to comprehend Grazioso Salvare's needs for the project and nail down exactly what they were looking for and what I would need to do to put those adjustments into practice. Because I wouldn't have often been as precise or exact. In order to provide additional value to my client's program in the future, I would probably use these techniques for producing and collecting data from databases.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists have the ability to develop smart software systems that help people either automate tasks or sort, store, and/or make sense of large sets of data.By giving businesses greater knowledge about their business processes or refining their business workflows to increase efficiency and, ultimately, profitability, work on these types of projects would help businesses accomplish their work more effectively.
